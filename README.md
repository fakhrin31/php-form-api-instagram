## üîë Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd your-project-root
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

This project uses [vlucas/phpdotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv) to manage environment variables and [cloudinary/cloudinary_php](https://github.com/cloudinary/cloudinary_php) for image uploads. Install them using Composer.

```bash
composer require vlucas/phpdotenv cloudinary/cloudinary_php
```

This will create the `vendor` directory and the `composer.json` file.

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project. **This file should be added to `.gitignore` to prevent leaking your credentials.**

```env
# Instagram API Credentials
INSTAGRAM_USER_ID=your_instagram_business_account_id
ACCESS_TOKEN=your_permanent_facebook_page_access_token

# Cloudinary Credentials
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```
